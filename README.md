### Project is closed, but Wiki for Linux users is still available

Since Rope now changed its backend it seems like Linux-based systems are fully supported.

Note as of Jun 26th 2024: Fully supported in the meaning of controls. Previous Rope versions GUI was based on Tkinter, which has a mouse wheel handler incompatible with Linux out of the box. So that was the main point of Rope EX existence - to bring all the controls to Linux back.
Speaking of capability of swapping - it was working from the very beginning, but you could do almost nothing without mouse scrolling back in the days. Now this problem is solved, but the problems with CUDA installation, I guess, remain the same.

But if for some unknown reasons you may need to test out old Rope versions on Linux, check out dev branch.

Installation instructions and troubleshooting in wiki are probably still up-to-date, so you can use them to install Rope to your Linux-based machine.

Sincerely,
Aqua
